1.3.9 (07.09.2008)
	+ Starting from this version the script is distrubuted under GNU GPL v3 license.

	  connection was used only with standard 443 port) — thanks to many people for report.

1.3.8 (24.04.2008)
	+ Ability to specify port number at the authorization screen (this function will be useful when
	  using port forwarding) — thanks to raas for help.

	! Added processing of commas and vertical bars in the links — thanks to AiSt for report.

1.3.6 (05.04.2008)
	* Fields for cookies' settings during installation process now will be blank by default. Fill
	  them only if you know what to specify in these fields.

	  any more — thanks to PyKaB for report.

	  button. I think that menu's structure is now more accurate.
